This code fetches data from the Star Wars API using JavaScript, which returns a list of characters. The code then converts the data to JSON format and iterates over it to create a new list item (li) for each character. Inside the for loop, the code assigns values to the list item that includes the character's name, gender, birth year, height, hair color, skin color, and an image of the character. The image is selected based on the character's name using conditional statements. Finally, the code adds each list item to the HTML document to display the character data on a web page and is designed using CSS.
